# My First HTML CV

This is my first project using **HTML**.
I created a simple CV page to practice the basic structure and tags that I learned in my first HTML lesson.

## what I learned 
- Basic structure of an HTML page (<!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>)
- How to use text tags like <p>, <b>, <em>, <h1>...<h6>
- Lists: <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <dl>, <dt>, <dd>
- Containers: <div>
- Adding simple styles with the <style> tag
- Meta tags: "charset", "description", "keywords"

## How to use 
Just open the file "test.html" in any browser to see the page.

## Future improvements
- Add CSS for better design and colors
- Add more personal information and links

This project is simple, but it is the **first step** in my web development journey.
